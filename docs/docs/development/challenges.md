# Development Challenges & Solutions

This document outlines the key challenges faced during the development of the Crypto Price Tracker and how they were resolved.

## API Rate Limiting

### Challenge
The free tier of cryptocurrency APIs often comes with rate limiting, which caused our application to fail when testing frequent refreshes.

### Solution
- Implemented a debounce on the refresh button to prevent excessive API calls
- Added proper error handling to gracefully handle rate limit errors
- Used React Query's caching to minimize unnecessary requests

## Search Performance

### Challenge
Initial implementation of the search functionality caused performance issues with larger datasets.

### Solution
- Moved filtering logic from a separate effect to the render method
- Implemented case-insensitive search
- Added memoization for filtered results to prevent unnecessary re-renders

```typescript
const filteredData = useMemo(() => {
  return data?.filter((crypto) => 
    crypto.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
  );
}, [data, searchTerm]);
```

## Responsive Design

### Challenge
The dashboard needed to look good on both desktop and mobile devices, but the table layout broke on smaller screens.

### Solution
- Implemented a flex-based design that changes layout based on screen size
- Used Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities for consistent styling
- Tested and optimized for various viewport sizes

## Type Safety

### Challenge
Working with external API data posed type safety challenges, especially when the API response structure might change.

### Solution
- Created detailed TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
- Used optional chaining and nullish coalescing for safer data access
- Added runtime validation for critical data paths

```typescript
export interface cryptoData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  symbol: string;
  current_price: number;
  price_change_percentage_24h?: number; // Optional fields marked appropriately
  image?: string;
}
```

## Next.js Data Fetching

### Challenge
Determining the best data fetching strategy in Next.js (SSR vs CSR vs ISR) for real-time data.

### Solution
- Chose Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for real-time prices that need frequent updates
- Implemented React Query's stale-while-revalidate pattern for optimal UX
- Added a loading state for initial data fetch to improve perceived performance
